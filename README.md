RecipeApp is fairly easy to use. Once you access the page, you will type a keyword into the searchbar. You can search by name of a dish, type of dish, or by an ingredient. Once entered, press the search button. Your results will appear below. Select the recipe you are interested in and it will direct you to the recipe page.

## Unsolved Problems
-When the recipe is selected, it loads the raw data. Will need to modify the data so that it renders better.


## Stretch Goals
-The About Page needs to be modified
-Add categories and other methods to search by.
